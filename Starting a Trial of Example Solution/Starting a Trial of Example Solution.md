**Starting a Trial of Example Solution**

You can start using the trial version of Example Solution right away after installation. The trial version of Example Solution is the best way to evaluate all the features of the product. This fully functional version produces content of the same quality as the full version. You can use the trial for 14 days. After the trial period is over, you will need to activate the product with the license key you receive after purchasing.

**Trial Version Limitations**

The only limitations of the trial version are the 14-day limit and an evaluation banner covering a part of the project area.

**Activating Example Solution License**

To start using Example Solution without the trial period limitations, you need to obtain a product license and activate it:

1. In the *Help* tab of the product toolbar, click the *Sign In* button to launch the Example Solution Activation Wizard.
1. If you already have an Example Solution license, enter your license key and click *Next* to proceed with entering *Registration Details*. To purchase Example Solution, click *Purchase Online*.
1. At the next step, you can specify the user's name and the company name. This information will be displayed in the *About* window of Example Solution.

After you complete steps 1, 2, and 3, you can choose whether to activate your license online or offline.

**Online Activation**

The fastest way to activate the license is to go through the online activation procedure. To do it, keep the *Activate my license online* now option checked and click *Next*.

After successful activation, you will see the number of remaining activations and the total number of allowed activations for your license.

**Manual Offline Activation** 

To perform offline activation:

1. Clear the *Activate my license online now* checkbox, enter your registration information, and click *Next*.
1. Choose *Activate the license manually* and click *Next*.
1. Send a license activation request with your License request code and License key via email to the Support Team.
1. After you receive a License activation code from the Support Team, paste it into the corresponding field and click *Next*. Manual activation requests are usually processed within one business day.

The activation process should be completed within 3 days after you enter the license key. If the license is not activated within this period, an evaluation watermark will be added to your projects.
